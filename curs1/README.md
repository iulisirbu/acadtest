# Introduction to Java Programming #

## What is Java? ##
Java is a programming language and computing platform first released by Sun Microsystems on May 23, 1995. The acquisition of Sun Microsystems by Oracle Corporation was completed on January 27, 2010. Java is one of the most widely adopted programming languages, used by some 9 million developers and running on 7 billion devices worldwide. There are lots of applications and websites that will not work unless you have Java installed, and more are created every day.
Java is fast, secure, reliable and long-term compatible, which ensures older applications continue to work now into the future. From laptops to datacenters, game consoles to scientific supercomputers, cell phones to the Internet, Java is everywhere! More details about the Java technology phenomenon here and glossary of terms.

## What is JRE? ##
The Java Runtime Environment runs the JVM (Java Virtual Machine), that enables you to run the software on any platform for which the JVM is available. It contains set of libraries and other files that JVM uses at runtime.

## What is JDK? ##
The Java Development Kit is the full featured SDK (Software Development Kit) for Java, including the JRE, compilers and tools (like JavaDoc and Java Debugger) to develop and compile Java Applications.

## What is Javac? ##
The Java Compiler compiles your Java code into bytecode. Source code file names must have .java suffixes, class file names must have .class suffixes, and both source and class files must have root names that identify the class. For example, a class called MyClass would be written in a source file called MyClass.java and compiled into a bytecode class file called MyClass.class. More details here.

## What is JVM? ##
The Java Virtual Machine serves as an interpreter between Java’s run-anywhere bytecode and your computer’s own system. While it runs, the JVM walks your computer through the execution of bytecode instructions. Basically, the JVM examines your bytecode, bit by bit, and carries out the instructions described in the bytecode. The JVM interprets bytecode for your Windows system, your Mac, or your Linux box, or for whatever kind of computer you’re using. That’s a good thing. It’s what makes Java programs more portable than programs in any other language.

## What is IntelliJ IDEA? ##
IntelliJ IDEA is a Java integrated development environment (IDE) for developing computer software. It is developed by JetBrains (formerly known as IntelliJ), and is available as an Apache 2 Licensed community edition and in a proprietary commercial edition.
