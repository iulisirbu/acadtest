# Introduction to Java Programming #

## What is Java? ##
Java is a programming language and computing platform first released by Sun Microsystems on May 23, 1995. The acquisition of Sun Microsystems by Oracle Corporation was completed on January 27, 2010. Java is one of the most widely adopted programming languages, used by some 9 million developers and running on 7 billion devices worldwide. There are lots of applications and websites that will not work unless you have Java installed, and more are created every day.
Java is fast, secure, reliable and long-term compatible, which ensures older applications continue to work now into the future. From laptops to datacenters, game consoles to scientific supercomputers, cell phones to the Internet, Java is everywhere!
